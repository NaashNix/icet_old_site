                                We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Generation Alpha, a dynamic
                                initiative spearheaded by the visionary entrepreneur Miuli Kalubowila. Under her
                                leadership as the founder and CEO, Generation Alpha is dedicated to fostering
                                education innovation
                                and entrepreneurship among Sri Lankan youth.

                                At iCET, we are committed to providing our students with the tools and resources
                                they need to thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of the software industry. Through
                                this partnership, we aim to empower our students to bring their innovative ideas to
                                life
                                and translate them into real-world applications.
                                <br> <br> One of the key objectives of our collaboration with Generation Alpha is to
                                create a supportive ecosystem where young innovators can access mentorship,
                                resources, and networking opportunities. By connecting
                                students with industry experts, investors, and mentors, we are providing them with
                                invaluable insights and guidance to help them succeed in their entrepreneurial
                                endeavours.
                                <br> <br> Additionally, our partnership with Generation Alpha offers students the
                                opportunity to develop essential leadership and soft skills that are vital for
                                success in the software industry. Through workshops, seminars,
                                and hands-on training sessions, students will gain practical experience and enhance
                                their professional portfolios, preparing them for fulfilling careers in the field of
                                software engineering.
                                <br> <br> We are excited about the possibilities that this partnership holds for our
                                students and are confident that it will enable them to reach new heights of
                                innovation and excellence. Together with Generation Alpha,
                                we are shaping the future of software engineering in Sri Lanka and beyond.

                            <p>At ICET, we believe in providing our students with a holistic and immersive learning
                                experience that goes beyond traditional classroom instruction. As part of our
                                commitment to excellence, we conduct Viva sessions periodically.

                                These Viva sessions play a vital role in the educational journey of our students,
                                allowing them to demonstrate their knowledge and practical skills to a panel of
                                expert lecturers and industry professionals.
                                <br> <br> Unlike written exams, which primarily test memorization and recall, Viva
                                sessions assess a student's depth of understanding, critical thinking skills, and
                                ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world
                                scenarios.
                                <br> <br> In our programs, Viva sessions serve as a platform for students to
                                showcase their knowledge and practical know-how acquired throughout the course.
                                Whether it's discussing coding techniques, explaining algorithmic
                                concepts, or presenting project prototypes, Viva sessions allow students to
                                demonstrate their mastery of the material and receive constructive feedback from our
                                expert panel.
                                <br> <br> By providing a platform for students to demonstrate their knowledge,
                                receive expert feedback, and engage with industry professionals, these sessions play
                                a crucial role in preparing our students for the challenges
                                and opportunities that lie ahead in their software development careers.

                                to showcase their skills and innovations. The recent Industry Minds event was a
                                testament to this commitment, as we witnessed our students
                                excel in presenting their industry projects and receiving recognition for their
                                remarkable performances.</p>
                            <p>Congratulations are in order for all the brilliant students who participated in the
                                Industry Minds event! Their dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking were
                                truly inspiring to witness. Each presentation reflected
                                not technical expertise but also the passion for making a difference in the
                                industry.</p>
